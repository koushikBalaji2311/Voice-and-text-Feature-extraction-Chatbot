This project is a Field Extraction Chatbot built using Streamlit, NVIDIA's API, and various Python libraries. The chatbot extracts key fields from user conversations and stores the data in a CSV file. It supports both text and voice input, making it user-friendly and accessible.

Features:

Natural Language Processing: Uses NVIDIA's Llama model to extract structured data from user conversations.

Voice Recognition & Text-to-Speech: Integrates speech_recognition for voice input and pyttsx3 for voice output.

Data Extraction & Storage: Extracts predefined fields from chat history and saves them in a CSV file.

User-Friendly UI: Built using Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive interface.

Error Handling: Provides real-time feedback for better usability.

Installation & Usage:

Install dependencies using requirements.txt.

Replace placeholders with your NVIDIA API credentials.

Run the Streamlit app using:
